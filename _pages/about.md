I am in the second year of pursuing a master's degree in software engineering at Chongqing University, whose advisor is [Sheng Huang](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2096/3496.htm). I have systematically learned the basics of machine learning and deep learning since my undergraduate studies and have been studying the task of automated pavement distress classification. From 2021 to 2023, I have published one **large pavement distress dataset**, one **ACM MM paper**, two **T-ITS papers**, and one **Electronics Letters** as the first or main author. Since September 2022, I have been working on medical image analysis research and have two preprints on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) classification under [ICCV2023](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/) review.

**Research interest**: high-resolution and fine-grained image classification, medical image classification, vision Transformer, weakly-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and deep reinforcement learning. 

## I am applying for a PhD candidate of Computer Science
I am interested in learning about the latest developments in computer vision and natural language processing, as well as their practical applications. I am eager to learn more about these topics and conduct research in these areas.

**Area of interest**: medical image analysis, multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning, aerial images analysis, weakly-supervised learning, and more.
